# Phishing Detector

A Chrome extension that detects phishing emails using a machine learning model with a Flask backend.

## Future Improvements

This project is actively evolving. Planned enhancements include:

- Expand the ML model with larger datasets and feature engineering
- Add more sophisticated NLP techniques (e.g., embeddings, transformers)
- Improve UI/UX of the Chrome extension popup
