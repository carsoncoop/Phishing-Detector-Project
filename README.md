# Phishing Detector

A Chrome extension that detects phishing emails using a scikit-learn machine learning model served by a Flask backend. This project demonstrates full-stack integration of frontend, backend, and machine learning.

## Future Improvements

This project is actively evolving. Planned enhancements include:

- Expand the ML model with larger datasets and feature engineering
- Add more sophisticated NLP techniques (e.g., embeddings, transformers)
- Improve UI/UX of the Chrome extension popup
